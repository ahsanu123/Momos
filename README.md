# 🐍 Introduction

MoMos - Motor Monitoring System, My Final Undergraduate  Project.  
Its Simple  STM32 connected to Raspberry pi  zero 2w, STM32 was used to  sampling motor vibration and current data, then  Raspberry was used for processing and  displaying to localhost.

contain design board of my final project, and program c/c++ and python.

## 💾 Hardware 

Hardware Actually made from 2 separate PCB, first PCB was used to  breaking  out STM32 Module  Pinout (its not backuped), and second PCB was used to place Raspberry Pi zero 2w.
